					<h3>WE LISTEN</h3>
					<div class="listen__info">
						<p>You’ve witnessed verbal or physical abuse at your location. You think a manager and an employee are getting a wee bit too close. Your limited financial knowledge is leaving you with questions about the current revenue…you know something is off.</p>
						<p>What do you do if you happen to come across something questionable? Your gut tells you something is wrong, but you feel you don’t have enough knowledge or information to let anybody know it’s happening. </p>
						<p>It’s often hard to know what would be considered misconduct and when (and if) you should be filing a report. If you think the behavior you are witnessing is questionable, this is your cue to speak up and use our company’s ethics hotline whether anonymously or full throttle into helping the current situation.</p>
						<p>Our third-party ethics reporting hotline and case management system allows employees to anonymously and confidentially file a report. Then allows the compliance team to quickly investigate and remedy a potential issue.</p>
						<p>The message is to use your common sense. If something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t. If you do report something and it turns out to be false, that’s okay too, this just shows you care enough to keep strengthening Phoenix. See something, say something, our leadership team cannot thank you enough for caring.</p>
